      <p class="w-10/12">Ulixee Cloud is designed to easily run and scale your production scripts across one or more clouds. At their most basic level, they host and serve your Datastores. As we build out Ulixee's decentralized cloud, these Cloud nodes can be connected as miners in the broader data economy.</p>
