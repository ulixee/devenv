Ulixee's Rigs are network hubs that provide services to “Ulixee Clouds”. Services include IP proxies, mainchain block tracking, and network resource (schemas/datastore) lookups. Rigs also provide a fixed IP address that can route through to Ulixee Node without a need for machines to provision static IP addresses.
