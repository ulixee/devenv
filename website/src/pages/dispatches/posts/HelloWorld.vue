<!--      <p>Welcome to the beginning. I'm Caleb Clark and I've been on an incredibly confusing journey for over-->
<!--        five years with Blake Byrnes my co-conspirator and fellow adventurer.-->
<!--      </p>-->
<!--      <p>-->
<!--        Five years ago we met for breakfast at "The Silver Skillet", an old 1950s era diner located adjacent to Georgia Tech's campus in Atlanta.-->
<!--      </p>-->
<!--      <p>-->
<!--        We had both been working on startups for most of our careers.-->
<!--      </p>-->
<!--      <p>-->
<!--        How do we keep the web open for innovation? How do we make it easier for developers to build new things? How do we stop the web from becoming a walled garden?-->
<!--      </p>-->
<!--      <p>-->
<!--        That naturally leads to the realization that the internet's movement toward ad-monopolies is a direct result of the lack of a native payment mechanism for the web. The web is free, but it's not free to build. So we've built a platform that makes it easy for developers to build and monetize their creations.-->
<!--      </p>-->
<!--      <p>-->
<!--        We wanted it to be global, and the first developers who began using our data tools were outside the U.S. So we decided to make it a global platform. We wanted it to be open, so we made it open source. We wanted it to be decentralized, so we made it decentralized.-->
