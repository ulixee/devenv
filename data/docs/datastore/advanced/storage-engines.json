A Datastore uploaded to a cloud must use a storageEngineHost to ensure data is available across all nodes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"configuring\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#configuring\">#</a>Configuring</h2>\n<p>When you upload a Datastore to a cloud, it will require you to set the <code>storageEngineHost</code> in the Datastore before uploading. You can also change out this ip:port locally to test out migrations or simply run tests against the production database.</p>\n<h2 id=\"payment\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#payment\">#</a>Payment</h2>\n<p>Storage Engines operate very similarly to Datastores. They can set their price per kb of data returned.</p>\n<h2 id=\"underlying-engine\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#underlying-engine\">#</a>Underlying Engine</h2>\n<p>The current underlying engine for Storage Engines is Sqlite3. However, it's expected that we will add Postgres and other engines in the future.</p>",
